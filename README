DSP (Download SPeed)
--------------------

This is a small command line tool that tests the download speed of
your internet connection. Results can be measured in bytes or bits,
and in either SI (metric) or IEC (binary) formats. You can provide
your own URL to test a download from, or simply just let the program
use its own defaults. Check out the usage details below.

Usage: dsp -[bBiLmMS] [--unit=UNIT] [--url=URL]
Options:
  -b, --bit              Show result measurements in bits
  -B, --byte             Show result measurements in bytes
  -m, --metric           Use SI metric measurements (multiples of 1000)
  -i, --binary           Use IEC binary measurements (multiples of 1024)
  -n UNIT, --unit=UNIT   Measure results stricty in UNIT
                           UNIT can be any of the following:
                             b or B - bits/bytes
                             k or K - kilo/kibi
                             m or M - mega/mebi
                             g or G - giga/gibi
                             t or T - tera/tebi
                           Whether the result is in metric or binary
                           depends on their respective options above
  -S, --small            Perform test using a small size download [about 13MB]
                           Fastest default test but with the least
                           accurate results
  -M, --medium           Perform test using a medium size download [about 40MB]
                           Slower than the default small test but
                           with slightly more accurate results
  -L, --large            Perform test using a large size download [about 82MB]
                           Slowest default test but with the most
                           accurate results
  -u URL, --url=URL      Perform test with URL instead of the default
  -?, -h, --help         Show this message and exit
  -v, --version          Show version information and exit
Defaults:
  If neither options `--bit' nor `--byte' are given, `--byte' is implied
  If neither options `--metric' nor `--binary' are given, `--metric' is implied
  If none of the options `--small', `--medium' nor `--large' are given,
    `--medium' is implied

The command line options above (except for the -u or --url=URL options) can
be provided separately or all together. For example, if you wanted to perform
the small download default test measuring only kilobits in IEC binary units,
all of the following commands would be equal:
    dsp -SnKbi
    dsp -ibSnK
    dsp -b -S -i -n K
    dsp -b -S -nK -i
    dsp --small --bit --binary --unit=K

To install on a Linux OS, make sure the libcurl development libraries are
installed and (from the dsp project directory) run:
    make
    sudo make install
