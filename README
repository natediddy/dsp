DSP (Download SPeed)
--------------------

This is a small command line tool that tests the download speed of
your internet connection. Results can be measured in bytes or bits,
and in either SI (metric) or IEC (binary) formats. You can provide
your own URL to test a download from, or simply just let the program
use its own defaults. Check out the usage details below.

Usage: dsp -[bBiLmMS] [-u URL]

Options:
  -b, --bit          Show result measurements in bits
  -B, --byte         Show result measurements in bytes
  -m, --metric       Use metric measurements (multiples of 1000)
  -i, --binary       Use binary measurements (multiples of 1024)
  -S, --small        Perform test using a small size download [about 12MB]
                       (fastest default test but with the least
                        accurate results)
  -M, --medium       Perform test using a medium size download [about 40MB]
                       (slower than the default small test but
                        with slightly more accurate results)
  -L, --large        Perform test using a large size download [about 80MB]
                       (slowest default test but with the most
                        accurate results)
  -u URL, --url=URL  Perform test with URL instead of the default
  -?, -h, --help     Show this message and exit
  -v, --version      Show version information and exit

Defaults:
  If neither options `--bit' nor `--byte' are given, `--byte' is implied
  If neither options `--metric' nor `--binary' are given, `--metric' is
    implied
  If none of the options `--small', `--medium' nor `--large' are given,
    `--medium' is implied

The command line options above (except for the -u or --url=URL options) can
be provided separately or all together. For example, if you wanted to perform
the small download default test measuring bits in binary units, all of the
following would be equal:
    dsp -Sbi
    dsp -ibS
    dsp -b -S -i
    dsp --small --bit --binary
